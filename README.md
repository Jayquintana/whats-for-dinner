## About
Whats For Dinner? Now that is a question every person has to continuously ask for the rest of our lives. Why not leave it up to our application to answer that question for you? Whats For Dinner is a website that randomly selects a side, main, and a dessert dish for you to cook, so you don't have to worry at the end of a busy night what to make for dinner!

## Try it out! [try it](https://jayquintana.github.io/whats-for-dinner/)

### Instructions

1. When the site first is loaded you will see two things. The dish selection, and the dish output!

2. The dish selection has four options. Side, main, dessert, and entire meal. The user gets the option to choose what dish the website will tell them to make. It's as easy as selecting a dish and clicking the "Lets Cook!" button.

3. Once you have selected a dish, the dish output will display a randomly selected side, main, or dessert dish that you should create!

4. If you want to select another dish at random, click the clear button and start over !
